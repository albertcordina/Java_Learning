 The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern
 Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform.

 A key element of Spring is infrastructural support at the application level: Spring focuses on
 the "plumbing" of enterprise applications so that teams can focus on application-level business logic,
 without unnecessary ties to specific deployment environments.

This part of the reference documentation covers all the technologies that are absolutely integral to the Spring Framework.
Foremost amongst these is the Spring Framework’s Inversion of Control (IoC) container.
A thorough treatment of the Spring Framework’s IoC container is closely followed by comprehensive coverage of Spring’s Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) technologies.
The Spring Framework has its own AOP framework, which is conceptually easy to understand and which successfully addresses the 80% sweet spot of AOP requirements in Java enterprise programming.
Coverage of Spring’s integration with AspectJ (currently the richest — in terms of features — and certainly most mature AOP implementation in the Java enterprise space) is also provided.
AOT processing can be used to optimize your application ahead-of-time. It is typically used for native image deployment using GraalVM.
